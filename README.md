ezStep - A Test Step Repository for Manual Testing
==================================================

###Motivation
This project was conceived to help speed up the processs of writingmanual test cases, while maintaining a sense of consistency and overall
quality of the test artifact.

When multiple testers are working on the same project s/he may use a different format or style of writing their tests. In addition having to
re-write the same step multiple times for different test cases. Whenever that particular step changes, all instances of that step must also 
be updated; which quickly becomes very tedious and time consumming. Using a test step repository can address these issues. 

###ezStep
A tester can write a test step one time and reuse it wherever applicable, and when a change is needed, one place to make the update. Also 
each test step is conformed to the same format, so there is consistency across a testing team. Test steps can be shared across multiple
testers and project teams.
